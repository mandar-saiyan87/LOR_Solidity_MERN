# 🧾 LOR - Letter of Recommendation (Web3 DApp)

A decentralized application for managing **Letter of Recommendation (LOR)** requests using blockchain, offering transparency, authenticity, and immutability. Students can request LORs, and authorized approvers (like professors) can approve or reject them. The metadata is stored on-chain, and the signed LOR PDF is stored on IPFS.
